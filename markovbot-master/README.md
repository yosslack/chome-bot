MarkovBot
=========

ABOUT
-----
This library allows you to generate random text using a Markov chain. It has a
single class, MarkovBot, which can read text files of your choice. You can then
make it generate random text. If you have a Twitter account, you can also make
the bot automatically reply to tweets of your choice, and you can make it
periocially tweet something.

For an explanation of Markov chains and Twitter bots, read [this post](http://www.pygaze.org/2016/03/sigmund-freud-twitter-bot/), and
for a very thorough tutorial on how to make your own Twitter bot by using this
library, [this post](http://www.pygaze.org/2016/03/how-to-code-twitter-bot/).

EXAMPLE
-------

The example.py script is really simple, and should be a good way to get you
acquianted with the basics of the MarkovBot class.
